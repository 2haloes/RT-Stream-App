# RT-Stream-App
A crossplatform program to play Rooster Teeth videos on low power devices

This application is currently in beta, however the 0.8.1 release is fully usable for public videos

This program is intended to be a completely cross platform Rooster Teeth video player (This is my second shot at it, however this seems to work a lot better than the last time)

The current release is completely crossplatform, only requiring .NET core to be installed (The next release will remove this requirement)

The 0.8.1 (current) release package contains running scripts, a batch file for Windows and a script file for OSX/Linux (As far as I know, it works in OSX however I do not own a mac and cannot confirm this)

More to come. Watch the milestone to see what's coming soon!
